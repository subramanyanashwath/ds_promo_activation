5. EXPERIMENT DESIGN & RESULTS
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS:
  • H0 (Null):       Proactive promotion outreach has NO effect on GMV growth
  • H1 (Alt):        Proactive promotion outreach INCREASES GMV growth rate

INTERVENTION TREATMENT:
  • MSM dedicated outreach call
  • 50% co-funded first promotion
  • Promo onboarding guide
  
CONTROL:
  • Business as usual (no proactive outreach)

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
  • Unit:                                 Merchant

  90-Day GMV Lift:                  $644.47            $593.54
  Statistical Significance:         p < 0.0001         p < 0.0001
  Variance Reduction:               N/A                82.36%
  
INTERPRETATION:
  • Treatment merchants showed $593.54 monthly GMV increase
  • Effect is highly statistically significant (p ~ 0.0)
  • CUPED methodology reduced variance by 82.4% (excellent)
  • Sample was properly balanced (SRM p=0.7158 >> 0.05)
